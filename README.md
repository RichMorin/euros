# Euros

Euros is a web spider framework that can spider a domain and collect useful information about the pages it visits.
It is versatile, allowing you to write your own specialized spider tasks quickly and easily.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `euros` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ]

```
